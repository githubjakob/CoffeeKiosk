# Project-Black-Alert

This app was created by a team of 5 students during the practical course "Mobile and Distributed Systems" at LMU in summer 2018.

## Idea

In collaboration with the Kiosk next to the Computer Science department, our team created an App that allows students to pre-order coffee.
The Kiosk owner get's notified through the apps push notifications and is able to inform the student once the coffee is ready.
